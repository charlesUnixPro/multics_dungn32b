Notes on porting to Multics.

"^L" replaced with "C %page". Turns out that sometimes confuses the 
free-form parser, so was changed to "C page" in some places.

"INCLUDE DPARAM.FOR" changed to "%include dparam". DPARAM.FOR renamed
to dparam.fortran.incl.

All usage of .AND., .OR., .XOR. and .NOT. on integer operands was
changed to AND(), OR(), XOR() and COMPL().

In game$initfl, the calculation of SHOUR and SMIN was just broken, and
was recoded to work correctly, fixing GTTIME().
