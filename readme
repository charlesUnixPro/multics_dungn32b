Notes on porting to Multics.

"^L" replaced with "C %page". Turns out that sometimes confuses the 
free-form parser, so was changed to "C page" in some places.

"INCLUDE DPARAM.FOR" changed to "%include dparam". DPARAM.FOR renamed
to dparam.fortran.incl.

All usage of .AND., .OR., .XOR. and .NOT. on integer operands was
changed to AND(), OR(), XOR() and COMPL().

In game$initfl, the calculation of SHOUR and SMIN was just broken, and
was recoded to work correctly, fixing GTTIME().

Multics FORTRAN does not allow mixing CHARACTER and non-CHARACTER in a common 
block: Moved ONAME to /PRSSTC/, PVOC, DVOC, AVOC, OVOC, VVOC to /VOCAB1/,
INBUF, SUBBUF to /INPUTC/, VEDIT to /MISC1/.

Redefined RECLNT to 20 (words).

Renamed PROGRAM DUNGEO to DUNGEON.

Moved all COMMON DATA specications to BLOCK DATA FOO.

Convert from DOS lines (cr/lf) to UNIX (cr).
