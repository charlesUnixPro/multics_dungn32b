Notes on porting to Multics.

"^L" replaced with "C %page". Turns out that sometimes confuses the 
free-form parser, so was changed to "C page" in some places.

"INCLUDE DPARAM.FOR" changed to "%include dparam". DPARAM.FOR renamed
to dparam.fortran.incl.

All usage of .AND., .OR., .XOR. and .NOT. on integer operands was
changed to AND(), OR(), XOR() and COMPL(). Old code marked as "Cold".

In game$initfl, the calculation of SHOUR and SMIN was just broken, and
was recoded to work correctly, fixing GTTIME().

Multics FORTRAN does not allow mixing CHARACTER and non-CHARACTER in a common 
block: Moved ONAME to /PRSSTC/, PVOC, DVOC, AVOC, OVOC, VVOC to /VOCAB1/,
INBUF, SUBBUF to /INPUTC/, VEDIT to /MISC1/.

Redefined RECLNT to 20 (words).

Renamed PROGRAM DUNGEO to DUNGEON.

Moved all COMMON DATA specications to BLOCK DATA FOO and BLOCK DATA BAR.

Convert from DOS lines (cr/lf) to UNIX (cr).

In OPEN statements, 'NAME' changed to 'FILE'. 

In OPEN of DINDX.DAT, 'BLANK=NULL' added to fix handling of short lines.

Open of DTEXT.DAT replaced with new code dtext_$open; read of DTEXT.DAT
replaced with new code dtext_$read.

Continuation lines changed to use '&'.

Several lines started with 'D'; presumably a conditional compile based on a
compiler debug flag; the lines were changed to start "C D".
